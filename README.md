## Data Sources and Project Ideas:  
1. Champions League Data  
  * [Data Set](https://sports-statistics.com/sports-data/sports-data-sets-for-data-modeling-visualization-predictions-machine-learning/) from sport-statistics.com  
  * Could explore correlations between top scorers, matchups, and coaching to performance in the Champions League.  
3. ACT Data  
  * [Data Set](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/act2044/viz/Superscore/Overview) from act.org  
  * Could explores how distributions of scores vary by state and connect it to median state incomes.  
5. U.S. Air Quality Data  
  * [Data Set](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data) from epa.gov  
  * Could explore the comparison of pollution by city and how this changes over time. Could see the effects of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  
7. Exchange Rate Data
  * [Data Set](https://www.x-rates.com/graph/?from=USD&to=EUR&amount=1) from x-rates.com  
  * Could explore how currency values have changed over time. Which currencies faces the most sever devaluation? Could supplement with [GDP data](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/country/by-country/startyear/ltst/endyear/ltst/indicator/NY-GDP-MKTP-CD) to plot the rates against GDP.  
9. Tornadoes in the U.S. Data  
  * [Data Set](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/tornadoes/1/10?fatalities=false) from ncei.noaa.gov  
  * Could explore the effects of climate change and increase in dangerous tornadoes. Were there outlier years? What were the circumstances? Could pair with geographic data or population density data.

Above is the link for a webpage that gives an overview of my latest project. I worked with a few partners to create a data set with each NFL team's coaching and performance information from 2002-2023. The goal was to visualize the patterns associated with coaching changes. We wanted to investigate if teams with more coaching changes performed differently than teams with fewer coaching changes. We went on to explore if the coaching changes were generally effective or not.
